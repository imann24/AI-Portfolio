Puck Wars uses the pucks environment to simulation small scale battles. It uses modifications of the shooter class, referred to as grunts to fight each other. The worlds for these battle simulations are found along the file path Puck-Wars/pucks-master/src/pucks/war. These worlds can be launched with the lein run pucks.worlds.war.battle1 command after cd-ing into the pucks-master directory in command line. There are 6 battles in total (labeled numerically: battle1, battle2, battle3, etc). They can all be launched in the exact same method as battle1. To see previous iterations of the grunt pucks or the worlds, go into one of the V0.0 folders and copy the code for a file into its corresponding .clj document in the pucks-master directory.
