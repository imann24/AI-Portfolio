This program is designed to reproduce a small portion of Pascal’s Triangle. It uses three building blocks: first the (factorial) function which calculates the factorial of a number. Then, the (pascal-line) function which produces a single line of pascal’s triangle. And finally, the (pascal) function which produces pascal’s triangle, up to the specified line. This program does have the limitation that it does not account for overflow.
