\f0\fs24 \cf0 This program is designed to reproduce a small portion of Pascal\'92s Triangle. It uses three building blocks: first the (factorial) function which calculates the factorial of a number. Then, the (pascal-line) function which produces a single line of pascal\'92s triangle. And finally, the (pascal) function which produces pascal\'92s triangle, up to the specified line. This program does have the limitation that it does not account for overflow. }
